# Loops in Python - Jupyter Notebook

## Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook demonstrating examples of loops in Python. Loops are essential in programming, allowing for repetitive execution of code blocks based on conditions.

## Contents
The notebook covers the following topics:
- `for` loop
- `while` loop
- Nested loops
- Loop control statements (`break`, `continue`, `pass`)
- Examples with real-world scenarios

## Requirements
To run the Jupyter Notebook, you need:
- Python 3.x installed
- Jupyter Notebook (install using `pip install notebook`)
- Any standard Python IDE supporting Jupyter Notebooks

## Usage
1. Clone this repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/loops-python.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the directory:
    ```sh
    cd loops-python
    ```
3. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
    ```sh
    jupyter notebook
    ```
4. Open `loops.ipynb` and execute the cells.
